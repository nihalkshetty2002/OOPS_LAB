//Create a flight class that has private data members: flight number (integer),destination (characters), distance (float), fuel (float). 
//a) Provide a default constructor that initializes distance to 500 kms always 
//b) Private Member functions: calculate_fuel()to calculate the value of Fuel as per 
//the following criteria: 
//Distance (in kilometers) Fuel (in liters) 
//<=1000 500 
//>1000 and <=2000 1100 
//>2000 2200 
//c) Public Member functions: information_entry() to allow user to enter values for 
//flight number, destination, distance which calls function calculate_fuel() to 
//calculate the quantity of fuel and display_info() to allow viewing flight details
